title: "Vehicle Count Using AI"
excerpt: "Imagine having many camares all over the city, thousands of GB of information, but don't have the necesarry time to view and count the vehicles, here is where AI comes in handy. <br/><img src='https://www.javeriana.edu.co/pesquisa/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/deteccion-y-conteo-vehicular.jpg'>"

This project purpose was to analyze many videos and extract the vehicle count in order to indentify denser areas and propose solutions when a natural disaster comes.

# Problem statement
------------------------------------
Currently, there is a significant amount of video footage available from fixed cameras monitoring a specific region. However, this data remains largely untapped. The absence of an automated system to analyze this footage and quantify vehicle types—such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks—limits the ability to make informed decisions during emergencies. There is a need for a scalable solution that can process this video data, count different types of vehicles accurately, and display the results in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to support disaster response and urban planning efforts.

# Introduction
-----------------------
Natural disasters and emergency situations demand swift and informed responses, often relying on accurate traffic and mobility data. Traditional manual analysis of traffic footage is time-consuming and inefficient, especially when dealing with a large volume of video files from multiple surveillance cameras. To address this challenge, this project proposes an automated system that utilizes computer vision techniques to process video footage from a defined area, classify and count vehicles—including motorcycles, cars, and trucks—and present the results on an interactive web platform.

This system will not only aid in understanding traffic patterns under normal and crisis conditions but also support decision-making for evacuation planning, resource allocation, and infrastructure improvements. By transforming raw video data into actionable insights, the solution aims to enhance situational awareness and disaster preparedness for both public authorities and urban planners.
