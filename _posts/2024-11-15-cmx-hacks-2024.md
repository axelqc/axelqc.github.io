Cemex Hacks is a three-day event focused on developing solutions that can change the future through digitalization, sustainable cities, or innovative resource use. My team and I proposed a concrete-based solution that transforms thermal energy into electrical energy.


INTRODUCTION
======
Monterrey has been experiencing the highest temperatures in all of Mexico, reaching 40°C (104°F). The high temperatures, the lack of trees, and the poor infrastructure of the electrical system contribute to a wide range of problems. The lack of trees increases the thermal sensation, which makes people turn on the Air Conditioner to relieve the warm temperatures. However, when many neighborhoods are consuming more significant amounts of energy, the system collapses, producing a power outage affecting many people. A possible solution is putting solar panels in the houses, but they're out of reach for many people because of the price. An UNAM study says thermal energy can be converted into electrical energy [Fuente](http://doi.org/10.22201/cuaieed.16076079e.2021.22.4.9), which will be the scope of our project.
