From a technical background, choosing a sales-oriented internship may need to be clarified. This post will explain the benefits I obtained during my sales internship and my motives for doing so.


Why sales?
======
For me, Data Scientists are more than just statisticians on steroids. They also need to be good speakers to convey their findings and explain the benefits of applying their models. We're also focused on business decisions and promoting change in an organization, and for that, communication, negotiation, and persuasion are necessary.

I needed to be better at speaking and building interpersonal skills. 

So, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and pursue a sales internship to invest in my future self and have the time to refine my communication and interpersonal skills.

What did I learn?
======
I did my internship at a cybersecurity-oriented company, so I took courses from Cisco and Meraki to understand the fundamentals of networking and build solutions around those products.

I also took courses from Dynatrace and Splunk to keep up with companies' current needs, which expanded my vision about how data is being massively collected and centralized to take a proactive approach to solving problems efficiently and getting insights fast. That also made me realize the importance of monitoring the performance of the solutions I develop to save time when something fails and be capable of knowing what was wrong.

But the important thing is communication, and so what did I learn about that? One of the key aspects of communication is hearing the other person, hearing what's important to them and what they care about, and asking the appropriate questions full of curiosity to obtain the maximum information and know what solution to propose.

Regarding talking and communicating better, the first thing is knowing your audience, what they care about, and their expertise on a certain topic. The best speaker is one who can make simple, complex things. After knowing your audience and adapting your message to their interests, talking will be much easier since you already have their attention. However, being to the point is great because people have tight agendas and many things on their heads. About confidence, the only thing you can do is practice; the more you practice public speaking and the more you practice your presentation, the easier it will be to speak to an audience.
