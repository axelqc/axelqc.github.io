👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year data science student at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

📚 I'm interested in data science, web scrapping, and automation. Throughout my bachelor's, I've undertaken complex mathematical courses, such as Topology and Modern algebras. Possessing a strong mathematical background has helped develop my critical thinking skills and expanded my vision to strive for new challenges in the AI field to solve problems and impact society.

🖥️ During my bachelor's I wanted to apply what I had been learning to the industry, so I looked for internships. My first internship was as a Data Analyst, following my second internship as an IT Energy Analyst. Currently, I'm a Sales and analytics intern to focus on my soft skills, communication, and interpersonal relationships. To know more about my experiences, apprenticeship, and learnings, check my [CV](https://axelqc.github.io/files/paper1.pdf).
