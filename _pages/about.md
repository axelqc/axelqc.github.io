![ML joke](/images/mljoke.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I’m recently graduated from my Bachelor’s **Degree in Data Science and Mathematics** at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

📚 I’m interested in machine learning, web scrapping, and automation. Throughout my bachelor’s, I’ve undertaken complex mathematical courses, such as Topology and Modern algebras. Possessing a strong mathematical background has helped develop my critical thinking skills and expanded my vision to strive for **new challenges** in the AI field to solve problems and impact society.

🖥️ During my bachelor’s, I wanted to apply what I had learned to the industry, so I looked for internships. My first internship was as a **Data Analyst**, where I learned about automating error detection with Python, followed by my second internship as an **IT Energy Analyst**, where I focused on web scrapping, forecasting, and full-stack development, utilizing a wide range of tools such as Python, JS, HTML, and PowerAutomate, and my third internship as a **Data Engineering intern** to focus on data pipelines, ETL, docker, and data lake.
